const kfpQuotes = `Po: So like, Oogway, was just a crazy old turtle after all?

Po: Skadoosh

Po: No, master! Don't die!
Master Shifu: *closes eyes*
Po: NO!
Master Shifu: I'm not dying you idiot! I'm relaxing!

Po: Oooooh... My Tenders!
Po: Oooooh... My tenders!

Mr. Ping: Once I had a dream that I ran away to make tofu.
Po: Then why didn't you!
Mr. Ping: Because it was a stupid dream.

Po: Wow, all of you look bigger than the action figure! Accept for you Mantis.

Oogway: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called present.

Oogway: You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There is a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.

Oogway: One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.

Oogway: The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!

Tai Lung: [Growls]

Master Shifu: Tai Lung has escaped from Chorh-Gom Prison!

Oogway: Oh, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad.
Master Shifu: Tai Lung has escaped from Chor Gom prison!
Oogway: That IS bad news!

Oogway: The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
Po: What?!

Po: Skadoosh.

Oogway: There is a saying, 'Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift! That is why it is called the present.'

Tai Lung: Finally! A worthy opponent. Our battle will be LEGENDARY!
Tigress: [Attacks Tai Lung, and the fight begins]

Tai Lung: So where is this Po? Did I scare him off?

Tai Lung: You have a new favorite.

Commander Vachir: Aww, did I step on the wittle kitty's tail? Awww...

Commander Vachir: AH HAHAHAHAHAHAH!

Master Shifu: I'm not dying, you idiot!

Master Shifu: Yeah.

Tai Lung: Who are you?
Po: Buddy, I... am the Dragon Warrior!
Tai Lung: You?
Tai Lung: He's a panda! You're a panda! What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
Po: Don't tempt me.

Po: You wanna get something to eat?
Master Shifu: [sighing] ... Yeah.

Tai Lung: The Scroll has given him power... NOOO!

Zeng: Let go of me!

Tai Lung: [Referring to Po] You?! [To Shifu] HIM?! But he's a panda!

Tai Lung: [Growls at Tigress]
Tigress: [Growls back]

Tai Lung: Tell me!

Tai Lung: [During his fight with Master Shifu] All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!!

Commander Vachir: [To Zeng] You're not going anywhere! [Referring to Tai Lung, who released himself and is trying to escape] And neither is HE!

Tai Lung: [Roars]

Tai Lung: WHO DENIED ME MY DESTINY?!?!?
Tai Lung: Who denied me my destiny?

Tai Lung: I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I have been forgotten. Fly back there and tell them "The *real* dragon warrior is coming home."
Tai Lung: I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I have been forgotten. Fly back there and tell them 'The *real* dragon warrior is coming home.'

Master Shifu: Panda, we do not wash our pits in the pool of sacred tears.
Master Shifu: Panda, we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

Po: Wow! The Furious Five! You're so much bigger than your action figures. Except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.

Oogway: One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.

Po: Stop it! I'm gonna pee!

Tai Lung: Shifu taught you well. But he didn't teach you everything. [Defeats the Furious Five]
Tai Lung: Shifu taught you well. [disables Monkey with a nerve strike] But he didn't teach you everything.

Tigress: OH! THAT'S IT!

Monkey: Po! Get up!
Tigress: You'll be late for work!
Po: Huh?

Tai Lung: So where is this Po? [Laughs] Did I scare him off?
Master Shifu: This battle is between you and me.
Tai Lung: So, that is how it's going to be...
Master Shifu: That is how it must be.

Tigress: [Bowing to Po] Master.

Tigress: You don't belong here.
Po: I know this is your room...
Po: I know this is your room.
Tigress: No, I mean you don't belong here in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning. *shuts the door*
Tigress: No, I mean you don't belong here in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning. [shuts the door]
Po: ...Big fan!
Po: Big fan!

Po: What was that?
Crane: I didn't...say anything.
Crane: I didn't say anything.

Master Shifu: The Dragon scroll.
Oogway: It is time.
Master Shifu: But who? Who is worthy to be entrusted with the secret to limitless power? To become: The Dragon Warrior?
Oogway: I don't know.

Po: There is no charge for awesomeness...or attractiveness.
Po: There is no charge for awesomeness... or attractiveness.

Oogway: I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom!
Po: (turns around, mouth full of peaches) Is that what this is? I'm so sorry, I thought it was just a regular peach tree!

Master Shifu: But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

Tigress: If he's smart he won't come back up those stairs.
Monkey: But he will.
Viper: He's not going to quit, is he?
Mantis: I'll tell you what, he's not gonna quit bouncing.

Po: How did I do?
Master Shifu: There is now a level zero.

Tai Lung: The wooshi finger hold!
Tai Lung: The Wuxi finger hold!
Po: Oh, you know this hold?
Tai Lung: You're bluffing, you're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that.
Tai Lung: You're bluffing. You're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that.
Po: Nope.
Po: Nope. I figured it out. Skadoosh!
Tai Lung: [smiles]
Po: I figured it out. Skadoosh. [explosion]

Master Shifu: Anything is possible when you have inner peace.

Oogway: There are no accidents.

Oogway: Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. But today is a gift, that is why it's called the present
Oogway: Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. But today is a gift, that is why it's called the present.

Mantis: WAIT! MY FAULT! I ACCIDENTALLY TWEAKED HIS FACIAL NERVE! ... And may also have stopped his heart.
Mantis: Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve! And may also have stopped his heart.

Tai Lung: You can't defeat me! You're just a big fat panda!
Po: I'm not a big fat panda. I'm THE big fat panda.

Po: There is no secret ingredient, it's just you.

Po: There is no charge for awesomeness...or attractiveness.

Mr. Ping: We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.

Po: Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.

Master Shifu: Po, you're alive! Or we're both dead.

Po:
Ah. My old enemy: Stairs.

Po:
My fist hungers for justice! [His stomach belches and the Furious Five stare at him; embarrassed] That was my... fist.

Po:
Skadoosh!

Po:
Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Mantis, Bunny! Wha? Oh sorry.

Shen:
[to Boss Wolf] Search the farthest villages! Find more metal! China will be mine!

Shen:
[to the Soothsayer when she eyes his robes] Don't even think about it!

Shen:
My father's throne. He used to let me play here at his side, promising one day, this throne would be mine. [throws his dad's throne out the window]

Shen:
[To his gorilla army] Bring it down!

Shen:
[While departing Gongmen City] Such sad, sad faces. But now is a time only for joy. You are going to be a part of something beautiful. [Tigress growls] Once we reach the harbor, in front of all the world, you and your precious Kung Fu will die, and China will know to bow before me. Set sail!

Shen:
Nothing stands in my way.

Shen:
[referring to Master Po] How many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda?!

Shen:
[to Po, then to his wolf army] As you wish. Let's finish this.

Po's Father:
[sensing Po] My son is alive!

Master Croc:
Vengeance is served!

Mr. Ping:
Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but look how it turned out. You got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles!

Shifu:
Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior...was the worst day of my life. By far, nothing else came close. It was the worst, most painful, mind destroying horrible moment...

Po:
Okay.

Shifu:
...I have ever experienced. [he shudders at the thought.] But once I realized the problem was not you, but within me, I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe.

Shen:
[enters the courtyard of his family palace] Good afternoon, gentlemen! Now that we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.

Master Ox:
Your house?

Shen:
Yes! Didn't you see the peacock on the front door? [spots the Soothsayer] Ah, there you are, Soothsayer. It seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.

Soothsayer:
We shall see, Shen.

Shen:
[under his breath] No, you shall see, old goat... [louder, to the Council] Where were we?

Thundering Rhino:
What do you want, Shen?

Shen:
What is rightfully mine... Gongmen City!

Thundering Rhino:
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council and we will protect it, even from you.

Shen:
[laughs] I'm so glad you feel that way! Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing! [indicating his wolf army dragging a rather large box on a cart]

Master Ox:
What's in the box, Shen?

Shen:
You want to see? It's a gift. It's your parting gift, in that it'll part you; part of you here, part of you there, and part of you waaaay over there... staining the wall!

Master Ox:
You insolent fool!

[Ox attacks, but is quickly brought down; Croc moves in, deflecting Shen's fan of blades. Finally, Rhino pushes Shen back with his hammer, knocking several of his fan blades away.]

Shen:
[sneering] Showoff.

Thundering Rhino:
That is a warning. You are no match for our Kung Fu.

Shen:
I agree. [grins wickedly] But this is! [flips backwards onto the box, revealing a massive cannon. Rhino takes a defensive stance... as Shen fires it.]

Shifu:
[to Po and the Furious Five, reading from a scroll] Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?

Po:
Master Thundering Rhino?

Shifu:
Yes.

Po:
Son of Legendary Flying Rhino?

Shifu:
[hands Po the scroll] Yes.

Po:
And the slayer of the ten thousand serpents in the Valley of Woe?

Shifu:
[sadly] He's dead.

[Po and the Five look at the scroll in horror]

Po:
Whoa.

Crane:
That's impossible!

Tigress:
Rhino's horn defense is impervious to any technique!

Shifu:
It was no technique! Lord Shen has created a weapon - one that breathes fire and spits metal! Unless he is stopped, this could mean the end of Kung Fu.

Po:
But I just got Kung Fu!

Shifu:
And now, you must save it! [points out with his staff] Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!

Po:
[starts running with the Five] Okay, here we go! Here we -- [as the Five leave, he turns back to Shifu] Whoa whoa whoa, wait...how can I do this? I mean, how can Kung Fu stop something that stops Kung Fu?

Shifu:
Remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace.

Shen:
Well, Soothsayer, why don't you tell me my...?

Soothsayer:
Fortune?

Shen:
Future. I was going to say future.

Soothsayer:
(peers into her bowl) If you continue on your present course, you will find yourself... at the bottom of the stairs.

[Shen looks down and is annoyed to see he has reached the bottom of the stairs leading to his throne.]

Soothsayer:
(still looking) I see... I see...

[Shen comes closer.]

Soothsayer:
I see... pain.

[She plucks out one of his feathers.]

Shen:
OW!

Soothsayer:
And anger.

[She chews on the hem of his robe.]

Shen:
How dare you! This is the finest silk in the province!

Soothsayer:
Followed by denial.

Shen:
This is not fortune-telling! You're just saying what's happening right...!

Soothsayer:
Now? The most important time is now.

Wolf Boss:
(running in) Lord Shen! I saw a panda!

Shen:
A panda? (Grabs wolf by the throat)

Wolf Boss:
A kung fu warrior He fought like a demon! Big and furry soft and squishy kinda plush and cuddly

Shen:
There are no more pandas

Soothsayer:
Even with his poor eyesight he can see the truth Why is it that you cannot?

Shen:
Oh brother. Find this panda and bring him to me!

Wolf Boss:
Yes sir!

Shen:
(scoffs) So, one panda lives. That does not make you right.

Soothsayer:
You're right. Being right makes me right.

Shen:
Then I will kill him, and prove you wrong. (turns and sees her eyeing the hem of his robe again) Don't even think about it!

Po:
[training with Tigress on the boat] So, um, this punching with iron trees? How long do you have to do that?

Tigress:
Twenty years.

Po:
Oh! Twenty... Twenty years. Is there any... you know a faster way, you know until you'll, you know don't feel anything?

Tigress:
No. Besides... [twists Po's fist, spins him in the air and lands on the floor; then smiles, watching Po's belly bounces to stop] I don't think Hard-style is... your thing.

Po:
Oh.

Tigress:
[on the boat to Gongmen City] Po, why are you really out here?

Po:
I just found out that my dad... isn't my dad.

Tigress:
Your dad? The goose?

[Po nods]

Tigress:
[deadpan] That must have been quite a shock.

Wolf Boss:
Is that all you got? 'Cause it feels like I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

Po:
Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!

Po:
[about the Massacre of the Pandas] You-- you were there.

Shen:
Yes. Yes, I was. [escapes]

Shen:
Call in the wolves! We sail at midnight! The Year of the Peacock begins now!

Wolf Boss:
Right now? 'Cause, it's the middle of the year, so you'd only get like half the Year of the Peacock.

[Shen glares furiously at him, raising one of his daggers.]

Wolf Boss:
...And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock. Happy New Year, sir.

Shen:
Get the wolves ready. We're loading the ships now... NOW! Now, now, now, now!

Shen:
[triumphantly] You were wrong, Soothsayer! [wields sword] We sail to victory tonight. Your magic panda is clearly a fool!

Soothsayer:
[angrily] Are you certain it is the panda that is a fool?! You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen!

Shen:
A trivial sacrifice... when all of China is my reward. [pokes the burning tip to a map of China, which bursts into a spreading flame]

Soothsayer:
Then will you finally be satisfied? Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?

Shen:
[Sneers] It's a start. I was also thinking of converting the basement into a dungeon.

Soothsayer:
[pause] The cup you choose to fill has no bottom. It is time to stop this madness.

Shen:
And why on Earth would I do that?

Soothsayer:
So your parents can rest in peace.

Shen:
[bitterly] My parents... hated me. Do you understand? They-- they wronged me. And... I will make it right.

Soothsayer:
They loved you. They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.

Shen:
[pause] The dead exist in the past. And I must attend to the future. [to his gorilla guard] Set the Soothsayer free. She is of no use to me.

Soothsayer:
[sadly] Goodbye, Shen. I wish you happiness.

Shen:
Happiness... must be taken. And I will take mine.

Shen:
Oh, you want to know so badly. You think knowing will heal you, eh? Fill some... crater in your soul? Well, here's your answer: Your parents didn't love you. But here... let me heal you.

[He jumps back to reveal a cannon aimed at Po, and lights the fuse. Po raises a wok as a flimsy shield, and the cannon blasts him back and out of the factory.]

Tigress:
NO!

Soothsayer:
Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. It is the rest of your story, who you choose to be.

[Realizing the truth in her words, Po remembers all the happy times he's had with his loved ones.]

Soothsayer:
So who are you, panda?

[Po slowly stands up.]

Po:
I am Po. And I'm gonna need a hat.

Po:
[standing on a rooftop] Shen! A panda stands between you and your...

[Cut to where Shen is standing, and can barely hear Po.]

Po:
[faintly] ...destiny!

Shen:
...What?

[Cut back to Po.]

Po:
Prepare for a hot serving of...

[Cut back to Shen]

Po:
[faintly] ...justice! Your reign of terror is over!

Shen:
[still not hearing] What?

Shen:
[trying to catch his breath] H-- how did you... how did you do it?

[Po shrugs]

Po:
You know, you just gotta keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose--

Shen:
Not that. How did you find peace? I took away your parents. Everything! I I-- I scarred you for life!

Po:
See that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.

Shen:
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

Po:
Oh yeah. What do scars do? They fade, I guess?

Shen:
I don't care what scars do.

Po:
You should, Shen. You gotta let go of that stuff from the past 'cause it just doesn't matter! The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.

[Shen's eyes widen]

Shen:
You're right. Then I choose THIS! [pulls out blades from his robes and starts attacking Po with them]

Ska2oosh!

Prepare for the return of awesomeness.

Shifu:
Inner peace. Inner.. peace.

Po:
Uhh!

Shifu:
Inner peace.

Po:
Master Shifu! Master Shifu, what do we got? Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain? Whatever it is, I will take them down! 'Cause I'm in a mood. I need to get something done. You know what I mean? Ahh.. What you doing?

Shifu:
One of master Hookway's final teachings.

Po:
Wow! Awesome! How did you do that?

Shifu:
Inner peace.

Po:
Inner peace! That's cool! Inner peace of what?

Shifu:
It's the next face of your training. Every master most find his path, to inner peace. Some chose to meditate for 50 years, in a cave just like this! Without the slimmest taste of food. Or water.

Po:
Or...?

Shifu:
Some finds in torture and suffering. As I did. Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior...was the worst day of my life. By far, nothing else came close. It was the worst, most painful, mind destroying horrible moment...

Po:
Okay.

Shifu:
...I have ever experienced. [shudders at the thought] But once I realized the problem was not you, but within me, I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe.

Po:
So that's it? I just need inner peace? My inners are already super-super peaceful.. So, all I need to do, is just get this thing going. Inner peace, you're going down! Now show me what were you doing that with your feet. I saw just sort of fancy boots..

Tigress:
Ho! Bandits, approaching the Musician's village

Po:
Danger! Tell those musicians to start playing some action music, because it is on! Don't worry, Shifu. I'll master inner peace, as soon as I get back.

Tigress:
No snack stops this time!

Po:
Ha-ha-ha! Snack stops! Wait, you serious?

Shen:
[enters the courtyard of his family palace] Good afternoon, gentlemen! Now that we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.

Master Ox:
Your house?

Shen:
Yes, didn't you see the peacock on the front door? [spots the Soothsayer] Ah, there you are, Soothsayer. It seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.

Soothsayer:
We shall see, Shen.

Shen:
[under his breath] No, you shall see, old goat. [aloud, to the Council] Where were we?

Thundering Rhino:
What do you want, Shen?

Shen:
What is rightfully mine... Gongmen City!

Thundering Rhino:
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council and we will protect it, even from you.

Shen:
[laughs] I'm so glad you feel that way! Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing. [indicating his wolf army dragging a rather large box on a cart]

Shifu:
[to Po and the Furious Five, reading from a scroll] Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?

Po:
Master Thundering Rhino?

Shifu:
Yes.

Po:
Son of the legendary Flying Rhino?

Shifu:
[hands Po the scroll] Yes.

Po:
And the slayer of the 10,000 serpents in the Valley of Woe?

Shifu:
[sadly] He's dead. [Po and the Five look at the scroll in horror]

Po:
Whoa.

Crane:
That's impossible!

Shifu:
Remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace.

Po:
Momma? Mom? Dad? Is that you? Mom! Dad!

Dad Panda:
Oh.. Hi! Hey-Hey.. Son, you are back.

Mom Panda:
Huh? Honey, what you doing here?

Po:
But I thought..

Mom Panda:
We replaced you, dear. with a lovely radish.

Po:
Radish?!

Dad Panda:
It's quite, polite, and frankly.. It does better Kung-Fu.

Po:
No.. No, no, no! Wait! Radish, radish, radish! Inner pea.. pea.. Inner peace. Inner peace, inner peace, inner peace... I'm.. Training.

Tigress:
The mast, is not the worthy opponent. I'm ready.

Po:
Okay.. So serious! I think I prefer the mast.

Tigress:
Apologies. I used to punch the iron wood trees by the fist in training. Now, I feel nothing.

Po:
That's severely cool!

Tigress:
Again!

Po:
[training with Tigress on the boat] So, um, this punching with ironwood trees? How long do you have to do that?

Tigress:
20 years.

Po:
Oh! 20... 20 years. Is there any... you know, a faster way, you know, until you'll, you know, don't feel anything?

Tigress:
No. Besides... [twists Po's fist, spins him in the air and lands on the floor; then smiles, watching Po's belly bounces to stop] I don't think hard style is... your thing.

Po:
Oh.

Tigress:
Po, why are you really out here?

Po:
I just found out that my dad... isn't really my dad.

Tigress:
Your dad, the goose? [Po nods] [deadpan] That must have been quite a shock. And this bothers you?

Po:
Are you kidding me? We're warriors, right? Nerves of steel, souls of Platinum. Like you. So hard core, you don't feel anything!

Tigress:
I was..

Mantis:
So, what you guys talking about?

Po:
Nothing.. Nothing!

Viper:
Po's having daddy's issues.

Mantis:
I'm so lucky, I don't have any problem with my dad. 'Cause my mother ate his head, before I was born. I don't know!

Viper:
Mantis, this isn't about you! Po, is the one freaking out.

Po:
I'm not freaking out.

Tigress:
Po..

Po:
I'm freaking in.

Tigress:
Po!

Po:
What?

Tigress:
We're here. Gongmen city!

Shen:
My father's throne. He used to let me play here, beside him. Promising with someday this throne would be mine. A little to the left.

Wolf Boss:
But it's so heavy, Master.

Shen:
Every thing, most be exactly how I visioned it. And I have visioned it a little to the left. Perfect! With the weapon, by my side.. A little bit more. With the weapon, by my side, all China will bow before me! We move out in 3 days, when the moon is full. And the tide is high. Well, Soothsayer, why don't you tell me my...?

Soothsayer:
Fortune?

Shen:
Future. I was going to say future. Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits.

Soothsayer:
[peers into her bowl] If you continue on your current path, you will find yourself... at the bottom of the stairs.

[Shen looks down and is annoyed to see he has indeed reached the bottom of the stairs leading to his throne.]

Soothsayer:
[still looking] I see... I see... [Shen comes closer] I see... pain.

[She plucks out one of his feathers.]

Shen:
OW!

Soothsayer:
And anger.

Shen:
This is not fortune-telling! You're just saying what's happening right...!

Soothsayer:
Now? The most important time is now. But if you really want to see the future...

Shen:
What do you see?

Soothsayer:
A peacock.. Is defeated by a warrior, of black and white. Nothing has changed!

[after the Soothsayer predicts - again - that Shen will be defeated by a "warrior of black and white"]

Shen:
[laughs] That's impossible, and you know it!

Soothsayer:
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

Shen:
Who?

Wolf Boss:
[running in] Lord Shen! I saw a panda!

Shen:
A panda!? [knocks him to the ground, gripping him by the throat]

Wolf Boss:
[nervously] A Kung Fu warrior. He fought like a demon! Big and furry, soft and squishy... uh, kinda plush and cuddly...

Shen:
There are no more pandas.

Soothsayer:
Even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth. Why is it that you cannot?

Shen:
[to the Wolf Boss, angrily] Find this panda, and bring him to me! (pushes him away)

Wolf Boss:
Yes, sir! [hurries away downstairs]

Shen:
[chuckles] So, one panda lives. That does not make you right!

Soothsayer:
You're right. Being right makes me right.

Shen:
Then I will kill him, and make you wrong! [turns and sees her chewing the hem of his robe again] WILL YOU STOP THAT?!

Tigress:
That must be Shen's palace, in the other side of the city.

Po:
Great! We will match in the tower, and proclaim; We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five, And we are here to bring you to justice!

Mantis:
What are you doing? This place is crawling with wolves.

Crane:
Hey! Isn't that the guy that hammered you in the face?

Po:
I do not like that guy!

Tigress:
We need to get to that to tower, without being spotted by those wolves.

Po:
Got it.. Stealth Mode! That noodles! Ow! Hello!

Po:
Yeah, okay.. Anyway. Where was I?

Tigress:
Where is, Po?

Mantis:
How can we lose a guy that big?

Po:
Guys, guys?

Monkey:
He-Hey, Po!

Po:
Sorry!

Crane:
So, that was Stealth Mode, Huh?

Po:
Let's be honest, not one of my stronger modes.

Wolf:
This rice is raw!

Sheep:
You stole of my metal pots for Lord Shen!

Wolf:
Either you cook my rice.. Or I cook you.

Crane:
Po, do something!

Po:
How am I suppose to help the cook-rice, while I'll get caught? Wait.. I have a better idea!

Wolf:
Three, Two, One!

Po:
Hey!

Wolf:
Hey!

Po:
We're here to liberate the city, and bring Shen to justice.

Sheep:
You will need help!

Po:
Thank you brave sheep, but it's too dangerous.. I can't let you.

Sheep:
Oh.. No, not me. It's not safe to speak you.

Po:
Right!

Sheep:
I'm talking about, Masters Ox and Croc! They are in Gongmen Jail, at Black Dragon area.

Po:
What? They're still alive?! They must be in that jail.. Gathering intelligents hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon. Okay, let's go! Thank you, sheep.

Wolf Boss:
Hey! Stop that costume!

Viper:
Take.. That!

Wolf Boss:
Now! Got you! Split up! Search every where!

Wolf:
What about over there?

Wolf Boss:
Is 'there' a part of every where?

Wolf:
I.. I guess.

Wolf Boss:
Then search there!

Po:
They must be close. I can feel a Kung Fu chill riding up my spine.

Viper:
[slides out the barrel] Sorry, Po. It's just me.

Tigress:
Look! 'Gongmen Jail'!

Wolf:
Oh.. It's cute.

Mantis:
Cute? Huh?

Tigress:
Nice work, Po.

Monkey:
At the first sight of trouble, I'll give you a signal. Gaga-Gagy!

Po:
You mean like Crane does?

Monkey:
Yeah!

Crane:
Excuse me! When have I ever, made that noise?

Po:
Master Ox! Master.. Master Croc! Hey.. Master storming, Ox! I can't believe, I'm rescuing actual legends of Kung-Fu. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here. Oh, good.. You found it! Come on you guys. Yeah! We're coming for you, Shen! Guys, are we going or not? Do you wanna do this later? I mean, you do wanna take back you city. Right?

Master Storming Ox:
Of course, we do. But if we stand up against Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city!

Po:
Listen to your self. You're protecting Gongmen city, by not protecting Gongmen city? If we all fight together..

Master Storming Ox:
Then the weapon would kill, everyone.

Po:
Oh, would it? Then we use, a sneak attack. We'll get inside, and then...

Master Croc:
And then you'll be stopped! By the unstoppable weapon.

Po:
No thing is unstoppable. Except for me. When I'm stopping you from telling me something unstoppable. Master Ox, I'm not let you stay in this cell!

Master Storming Ox:
Then let's just see how you get me out!

Po:
You guys see that? It's called being awesome! Come on! what ever happen to be a hero?

Master Croc:
The only hero in this town, is the dead one.

Master Storming Ox:
Like I said; You are not getting me outta this cell!

Po:
Yes! Alright. Let's go!

Master Croc:
I get the top bunk.

Master Storming Ox:
It's time to surrender, panda. Kung-Fu is dead!

Po:
I.. You.. You.. Kung-Fu is a dea..aa.ad! Fine! You stay in your prison of fear! With bars made of hopelessnest. And all you get is 3 square meals a day of... Shame.

Master Croc:
With disparateful dessert.

Po:
We'll take on Shen. And prove to all those who hunger for justice! And honor, 'The Kung-Fu still lives'.

Boar Prisoner:
Yeah!

Wolf Boss:
Is that all you got? 'Cause it feels like I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

Po:
Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder! Why there are.. so.. many.. signs? Come here! I like to squash.. Yes! Taste of the defeat. Let me tell you something.. Next time you miss with a panda, you better bring a whole...

Wolf Boss:
Guess no body told you; If you miss with a wolve.. You'll get the fangs. I hit you twice.. what are you gonna do now?

Po:
We surrender!

Crane:
You could chain my body but you will never chain my.. warrior spirit.

Po:
They don't forget the little guy!

Mantis:
Did you just called me..

Tigress:
Po, what're you doing?

Po:
Trust me, I gotta a... pla..ww! No way! Eight point akupressur cuffs! Just like the one that held Tailong, the more you move the tier they get.. These are the best cuffs.

Shen:
Greetings, panda. At last we meet. No. No, no, no.. We meet at last! Yes! That's it! Greetings, panda. We meet at..

Soothsayer:
You are afraid for a reason.

Shen:
I'm not afraid. He's coming to me in chains. Have anyone should be afraid?

Soothsayer:
You!

Shen:
Don't you, little sick goat!

Po:
[after Shen shows off his Feathers, causing Po to have another vision about the Massacre of the Pandas] You-- you were there.

Shen:
Yes. Yes, I was. [escapes]

Master Storming Ox:
Oh.. You! What did you do? It's chaos up there. What happened to stopping Shen?

Po:
Yeah.. Guys, come on! Give me a little credit. I meant for him, to get away. 'Cause.. It's a trick. There's a lot! I was thinking, of.. figure out his plan.. more.

Mantis:
That makes, no sense.

Po:
What you mean? What you mean? It sure does.

Tigress:
Po, the truth! You had Shen. What happened?

Po:
What're you talking about? What're you.. I don't know, what are you talking about? Uh.. Yeah! Ahh.. You got me of course.

Tigress:
The truth! Fine! They'll keep you far from danger.

Master Croc:
Realist far!

Po:
What?

Tigress:
You're staying here.

Po:
Wa.. Wait! I have to go back..

Tigress:
You are staying here.

Po:
I'm going. And you can't stop me! Okay, I wasn't ready that time.

Viper:
Guys, don't!

Tigress:
Ready!

Po:
Look!

Viper:
Stay down!

Po:
I have to get to him.

Tigress:
Then, tell me why.

Po:
He was there. Okay? The peacock was there, the last time I saw my parents. He knows what happened. Where I came from. Who I am. Look, I'm going. I have to know. The hard core can't understand.

Viper:
Tigress.. No!

Tigress:
The hard core do understand. But I can't watch my friend, be killed. We're going.

Crane:
Hey! Maybe you can't watch me be killed.

Tigress:
Stop it one wing.

Monkey:
And.. She's back!

Master Storming Ox:
Don't worry, kid. You're better off here.

Shen:
[triumphantly] You were wrong, Soothsayer! [wields sword] We sail to victory tonight. Your magic panda is clearly a fool!

Soothsayer:
[angrily] Are you certain it is the panda that is a fool?! You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen!

Shen:
A trivial sacrifice... [sticks the sword's tip into a nearby fire, then pokes the burning tip to a map of China, which bursts into a spreading flame] when all of China is my reward.

Soothsayer:
Then will you finally be satisfied? Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?

Shen:
[sneers] It's a start. I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.

[Her anger spent, Soothsayer approaches the peacock, who is standing at the balcony with his back to her.]

Soothsayer:
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom. It is time to stop this madness.

Shen:
[chuckles] Why on Earth would I do that?

Soothsayer:
So your parents can rest in peace.

Shen:
[bitterly] My parents... hated me. Do you understand? They-- they wronged me. And... I will make it right.

Soothsayer:
[sadly] They loved you. They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.

Shen:
[pause] The dead exist in the past. And I must attend to the future. [to his gorilla guard] Set the Soothsayer free. She is of no use to me.

Soothsayer:
[heartbroken] Goodbye, Shen. I wish you happiness.

Shen:
Happiness... must be taken. And I will take mine.

[The gorilla guard leads the Soothsayer out]

Shen:
Why aren't we firing?!

Wolf Boss:
They're taking out our gunners, sir! They're getting close!

[Shen sees Po marching at him]

Shen:
Fire! FIRE AT THEM!

Wolf Boss:
But, sir, we'll kill our own!

Shen:
[shouting] I SAID FIRE AT THEM! FIRE!

[Po keeps fighting the wolves, Wolf Boss looks at Shen then flings down his torch]

Wolf Boss:
[last words before his death] No.

[Shen kills Wolf Boss with one of his knifes]

[After Po destroys Shen's weapons]

Shen:
[trying to catch his breath] H-- how did you... how did you do it?

Po:
[shrugs] You know, you just gotta keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose--

Shen:
Not that! How did you find peace? I took away your parents, everything! I-I-- I scarred you for life!

Po:
See, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.

Shen:
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

Po:
Oh, yeah. What do scars do? They fade, I guess?

Shen:
I don't care what scars do.

Po:
You should, Shen. You gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter! The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.

Shen:
[last words before his death] You're right. Then I choose THIS!

[A duel ensues between them, lasting until Shen is crushed to death by his own cannon; Po is flung off the boat and into the water. Everyone watches worriedly; Po emerges]

Po:
Whew... [looks at the dock next to him]

Tigress:
[appears and helps him up] That... was pretty hardcore.

Mother Pig:
What do you mean he's not here?! It's my son's birthday! All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior!

Mr. Ping:
How about some tofu birthday cake, instead?

Mother Pig:
You know what... we'll try again some other time. When do you think he'll be back?

[The words break Mr. Ping's heart. Before they know it, he's in tears]

Mr. Ping:
I don't know, okay?! I DON'T KNOW! Maybe never! I mean, I worry, okay, I'm his dad... or at least I was his dad... [flings himself across the table] Why did he have to go and save China...? I know why, but why? [sniffs] My little panda...

[The mother pig's son starts laughing; Mr. Ping gets up, turns around and sees Po with two radish baskets. Mr. Ping approaches Po and hugs him]

Mr. Ping:
So, how did it go, did you save China?

Po:
Yep.

Mr. Ping:
I knew you would... that's why I had these new posters made... [He pulls out a poster of Po] "My son saved China. You too can save, buy one dumpling get one free!"

Po:
Hey, that's a pretty good deal. But first... [sets down the baskets] ...There's something I should tell you. [Mr. Ping gulps] While I was gone... I found the village where I was born... I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.

Mr. Ping:
You did?

Po:
I know who I am.

Mr. Ping:
[Barely speaking] You do?

Po:
I'm your son. [The two embrace] I love you, dad.

Mr. Ping:
I love you too, son. Delicious fat radishes. You're probably hungry. Let me cook something for you.

Po:
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

Mr. Ping:
No, no. I'll cook.

Po:
Dad?!

Mr. Ping:
It's the least I can do. You saved China!

Po:
No.. It's the least I can do. You raised me!

[Last line; in a location far from the Valley of Peace, a large circular shape is sitting in a shrine. It gets up and is revealed to be a male panda]

Li Shan:
My son is alive. [steps out of the shrine and looks down upon a small farming village, which is populated by pandas just like himself. The pandas below catch his gaze]

Shen:
Greetings, panda. At last we meet. No. No, no, no.. We meet at last! Yes! That's it! Greetings, panda. We meet at..

Soothsayer:
You are afraid for a reason.

Shen:
I'm not afraid. He's coming to me in chains. If anyone should be afraid it's--



Shen:
Don't even think about it.

Mr. Ping: Sometimes we do the wrong things, for the right reasons
Mr. Ping: Sometimes we do the wrong things, for the right reasons.

Po: I think I just peed a little!

Shifu: If You only do what you can, You will never be more than you are now.

Po: Listen closely because I'm only going to repeat this ten times.

Li: Panda's don't walk. We roll!

Po: Cut the chit-chat!

Kai: Kai has return!

Po: Your real strength comes from being your best you.

Mr. Ping: Having you in his life doesn't mean less for me. It means more for him..
Mr. Ping: Having you in his life doesn't mean less for me. It means more for him.

Mr. Ping: Your son got angry at you. Welcome to parenthood.

Shifu: Time is just an illusion, there is only the now.

Po: I'm going to turn you into kung fu masters.

Po: You're just like me be old.

Po: You look just like me, but a baby.
